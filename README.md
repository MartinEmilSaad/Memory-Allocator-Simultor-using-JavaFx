# Memory-Allocator-Simultor-using-JavaFx
This project was created using JavaFX to simulate memory allocations using different algorithms which are : first-fit , best-fit and worst-fit.

This project was created using intellij

## This project was converted to be a desktop app using launch4j (from jar file to exe)

### How to use 

1 - Enter the size of your memory
2 - Enter the starting addresss of a free block of memory that can be allocated to one of the processes then enter it's size and press the button : "press here to enter the new memory location" , then repeat this until you enter all your free blocks of memory.
Any other blocks will be considered occupied.

3 - In the third textfield enter the size of the process and then press enter


### Output 

Number of blocks arranged side by side assembling memory shape after each process is added or not (if there is not enough space for it)
